                    <p>Jennie Kim, known as <i>Jennie</i>, was born in Cheongdam-dong, South Korea on January 16, 1996. Jennie studied abroad in New Zealand. She joined YG in August 2010.
                    Jennie Kim was born in Cheongdam-dong, South Korea and grew up in Auckland, New Zealand until her high-school years, when she moved back to South Korea. 
                    After she settled in Seoul, she immediately became a trainee of <i>YG Entertainment</i> in 2010. She was raised abroad, so she speak fluent English. 
                    She is also fluent in Korean and Japanese. She was only 14 when she joined YG, but she has proved that she has much potential. She has also collaborated with her fellow YG artists before she was cast as a member of Blackpink. 
                    Jennie is said to be the possible leader of the group, but after the band debuted, there was no leader because of their similar ages.
